BUGS:	
	If during debugging I stay in break mode for a bit more time then signalR disconnects with exception

FIXED:
	walls can't be serialized for some reason
		Cause: if class has more than one non-default constructor, jsonserializer doesn't know which one to choose
	nullreference exception in yoke if you have mouse on game window when game is starting
